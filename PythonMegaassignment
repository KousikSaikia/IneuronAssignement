Q1 - Q25 : https://github.com/KousikSaikia/IneuronAssignement/blob/main/PythonAssignment-1.md

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

String is a data type. we can use str to declare a string in python.

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?

We can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [] 

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

string = "Big Data iNeuron"

print(string.split()[-1])

desired_output = "iNeuron"
Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.

string[::-1]

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?

del or assign an empty string

Q32. What is escape sequence?

 Escape sequences are typically used to specify actions such as carriage returns and tab movements on terminals and printers.

Q33. How can you print the below string?

'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

using print function

Q34. What is a list in Python?

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?

By defining the data using comma separated form inside square barcket.

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?

using index of the list items.

Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]

lst[4][2]

Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.

list1 = input("Enter the values of list using space: "))
print(len(list1.split())


Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.

lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst.insert(3, "Big")

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?

Tuple is one of the data type in python that can store multiple values in a single variable. Major difference with list is tuples are immutable and list can be modifies.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?

tup = (1,2) - please the elements between brackets

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

Tuples are immutable and hence cannot modified to append an item

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

tuples are immutable and hence cannot be appned.

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.

lst = ("Welcome", "to", "Data", "course")
print(len(lst))

Q45. What are sets in Python?

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data

Q46. How can you create a set?

set1 ={} , by placing the values between the curly braces.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

set1 = {'iNeuron'}

set1 = set()
set1.add("iNeuron")
print(set1)

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.

set1 = set()
set1.add("iNeuron")
set1.add("Big")
set1.add("data")
set1.add("camp")
print(set1)

Q49. How is update() different from add()?

We use add() method to add single value to a set. We use update() method to add sequence values to a set

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

clear will delete all the elements in a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?

Python frozenset() Method creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function.
As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

fronzen sets are immutable. It accepts only itterable object.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.



Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

Q58. What will the output of the following?

var = {}
print(type(var))
Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.

Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.

Q62. What is the use of get() function?

Q63. What is the use of items() function?

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?

Q67. What is the use of values() function?

Q68. What are loops in Python?

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
